# StarDust - Astrophotography Central [IN DEVELOPMENT]

## Idea
StarDust is THE platform for astrophotographers. 

It's a place where they can:
* Share their best work with the world
* Help others pursue their interest in astrophotography
* Trade/Buy astrophotography equipment
* Recognize constellations based on the uploaded photos
* And much more to come :)

## Technological vision
The platform will be built by using a microservice approach and a heterogenous tech stack. You should expect to see the finest Node.js, Python, Golang and Java microservices, working together with SQL and NoSQL databases, data streams with Kafka and much more.

Stay tuned :D
